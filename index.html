            <li>Developed a Live Recharge Status Panel to get success and error percentage of any operator. It helped the Business team in deciding the re-routing of any operator through other gateway. It also facilitated the disabling of validation call in case error percentage is high. Data was stored in ElasticSearch and D3 along with Django was used for displaying graphs.</li>
            <li>Created a Gateway Sequencing and Operator Re-routing panel. This helped the Operations Team to re-route any operator through a particular gateway at run-time. Used D3's Dendogram to represent operator and Django</li>

            <li>Developed a plugin based system in Nodejs to interact with courier for services like Order creation, cancellation and tracking. The system handles 1K request per minute and logs each interaction with courier into ElasticSearch. A <a href="https://github.com/paytm/courier-plugin-sdk-nodejs">courier-sdk</a> was also written so that any courier can easily write a plugin and integration time is decreased eventually</li>
            <li>Developed a retry mechanism, as a service over queue based framework RabbitMQ. Service is written in such a way so that it can be easily plugged into any client and failure rates for the client can be drastically reduced.</li>
